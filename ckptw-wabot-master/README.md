### Adding a New Plugin

To add a new plugin, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `plugins` folder with your desired functionality. For example, `ping.js`:

   ```javascript
   // plugins/info-ping.js

   module.exports = {
     name: 'ping',
     category: 'info',
     code: async (ctx) => {
       ctx.reply('Pong!');
     }
   };
   ```

2. Your plugin is now ready to use. Users can trigger it by sending `/ping` in the chat.
